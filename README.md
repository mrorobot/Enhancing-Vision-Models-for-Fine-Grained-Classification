## Project Overview
This project explores the use of advanced vision models to improve fine-grained classification. The models employed include EfficientNet, MobileNet, Vision Transformer, and Vision Transformer with Rotary Embeddings. The project is divided into three parts:

1. **Part 1: Dog Vision Dataset**
2. **Part 2: Food Vision Dataset**
3. **Part 3: Fashion MNIST Dataset**

## Datasets
- **Dog Vision Dataset:** A dataset of images of different dog breeds.
- **Food Vision Dataset:** A dataset of images of various food items.
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset:** A dataset of images of clothing items.

## Models
- **EfficientNet:** A family of convolutional neural networks that have been optimized for both speed and accuracy.
- **MobileNet:** A lightweight convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT):** A transformer model designed for image classification tasks.
- **Vision Transformer with Rotary Embeddings:** An enhanced version of ViT with rotary positional embeddings for better performance.
